# Requirements
## Introduction
In this project the user can help user retro fit a smart engergy meter on top of the exisinting system.

## Research

High energy consumption by our household appliances is quite bothering and each month we make every possible effort to reduce the electricity bill. Not just that, in the quest to understand and monitor the power usages, we keep checking electricity meters installed in our home/offices. What if we can monitor the electricity bill from anywhere on our smartphones? Yes, with the help from the Internet of Things, we can easily monitor power consumption using a smart energy meter. We have previously done other IoT based Remote Monitoring projects like Temperature and Humidity Monitoring, Battery Monitoring, Food Monitoring, Air Quality Monitoring

## Defining Our System
   
1) Current Sensing
A Binary number system has only two digits that are 0 and 1. Every number (value) represents with 0 and 1 in this number system. The base of binary number system is 2, because it has only two digits.
2) Calculations
Octal number system has only eight (8) digits from 0 to 7. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 in this number system. The base of octal number system is 8, because it has only 8 digits.
3) Over Current Protection
Decimal number system has only ten (10) digits from 0 to 9. Every number (value) represents with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8 and 9 in this number system. The base of decimal number system is 10, because it has only 10 digits.


## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT-Sample](https://us.123rf.com/450wm/vectorscore/vectorscore1708/vectorscore170800056/84399177-swot-analysis-font-design-with-main-objectives-project-management-template.jpg?ver=6)
## Strenghts:
1.With number system convertion  users can convert a given number system to any other number system.
2.Users can save their time ,without finding it manually.
3.users can reduse the time and effort .
4.Easily get Output. 


## WEAKNESS:
1.Vulnerable to viruses.
2.May encounter with Bugs.

## Oprtunity:
1.  Can used for Teaching Purpose
2.   .

## Threats:
 1. Application may crash somtimes.
 2. Can hit error when given huge value.
